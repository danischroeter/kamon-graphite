# kamon-graphite

Write report metrics in graphite format.
Per default the graphite tag support (available since graphite 1.1) is enabled (see include-tags feature flag).

## Config
    kamon{
        graphite {
            # Hostname and port in which your Carbon daemon is running.
            hostname = "127.0.0.1"
            port = 2003
    
            # Prefix for all metrics sent to Graphite.
            metric-name-prefix = "kamon-graphite"
    
            # instead of adding tags as suffix to metric name (format graphite 1.1) metricname;tag1=value1;tag2=value2
            # the metric will be named metricname.tag1.value1.tag2.value2
            legacy-support = false
    
            # For histograms, which percentiles to count
            percentiles = [50.0,90.0,99.0]    
    
            additional-tags {
                service = "yes"
                host = "yes"
                instance = "yes"
                blacklisted-tags = []
            }
    
            filter-config-key = "graphite-tag-filter"
    
        }
        util.filters {
            graphite-tag-filter {
                includes = ["**"]
                excludes = []
            }
        }
    }
    
## Usage

Example config

application.conf

    kamon {
      reporters = ["kamon.graphite.GraphiteReporter"]
      environment {
        service = "supercool-app"
        tags {
          env = "local"
        }
      }
      graphite {
        hostname = "127.0.0.1"
        port = 2003
      }
    } 
    
Main

    Kamon.loadReportersFromConfig()       

## Failure handling
When sending metrics at a tick interval fails the current snapshot will be dropped and the next snapshot will try to send metrics using new connection.
